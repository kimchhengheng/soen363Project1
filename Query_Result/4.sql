-- AFTER STUDYING THE LIST OF QUERIES, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT INDEXING FOR ATTRIBUTES THAT WERE MOST SEARCHED FOR
-- AS WELL AS ATTRIBUTES PRESENT IN THE QUERIES WITH THE LONGEST EXECUTION TIMES.

-- INDEXING MOVIE -> TITLE
CREATE INDEX index_TITLE
ON MOVIES (TITLE);

-- INDEXING ACTOR -> NAME
CREATE INDEX index_NAME
ON ACTOR (NAME);

-- B 
-- ALL EXECUTION TIMES ARE UNDER THE FOLDER "EXECUTION TIMES"

-- AFTER PROFILING THE QUERY EXECUTION TIMES WITH AND WITHOUT INDEXES, WE NOTICED THAT THE EXECUTION TIME
-- OF THE QUERY FROM QUESTION 3-K-2 DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE DROP WENT FROM 45.926 SECONDS TO 28.763 
-- SECONDS. AS THE REMAINDER OF THE QUERY'S EXECUTION TIMES ARE BELOW 0.5 SECONDS, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO
-- TO NOTICE AN CONCRETE IMPROVEMENT WHEN USING INDEXES. 

-- C
-- USING MATERIALIZED VIEWS
-- THE EXECUTION TIME WENT FROM 45.926 (WITHOUT INDEXES) TO 28.763 (WITH INDEXES) 
-- TO 0.023 (WITH MATERIALIZED VIEWS) SECONDS. THIS IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.
